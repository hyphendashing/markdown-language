# This is just a small venture into the world of the markdown language.   
## What is "Markdown Language"?      
![markdown language logo](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/48/Markdown-mark.svg)   

*Markdown is an easy-to-read, easy-to-write language for formatting plain text.*

See the following [link](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) for a nice markdown cheat sheet.

Apart from formatting text you can also add pictures to your readmes and- / or github presentations.

Prettier code presentation can also be done, for example:   

```json
{
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Smith",
  "age": 25
}
```   

or   

```python
#Simple Python calculator

p = int(input("Enter the first input: "))
q = int(input("Enter the second input: "))
oper = input("Enter the type of operation you want to perform (+, -, *, /, %): ")
result = 0
if oper == "+":
    result = p+q 
elif oper == "-":
    result = p-q
elif oper == "*":
    result = p*q
elif oper == "/":
    result = p//q
elif oper == "%":
    result = p%q 
else:
    print("Invalid Input")
print("Your answer is:",result)
```
Paste and run the code above into the online Python IDE [here](https://www.online-python.com/) to try it out.

There's **a lot** you can do with the markdown language. It even support emojis ( :wink: ). Be sure to check out the cheat sheet I linked to earlier if you want to see all the bells and whistles.

That's it for now! Take care. :raising_hand_man:
